# Artifact for the paper "Routing on Multiple Optimality Criteria"

## 1. Introduction

This is the artifact for the paper “Routing on Multiple Optimality Criteria”. This artifact consists of a simple simulator for dominant-paths vectoring protocols, both non-restarting and restarting versions, and the scripts for: (1) transforming Rocketfuel topologies into network data sets that serve as input to the simulator; and (2) generating plots with CCDFs of number of dominant attributes and termination times of dominant-paths vectoring protocols from the data sets that are outputted by the simulator.
